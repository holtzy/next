# What's next ?

I currently have a [bunch of online project](https://www.yan-holtz.com), mainly related with the field of data visualization. 

This repo is the place where I list my new ideas & comment them with useful links, until I potentially make them true. Feel free to comment!

Visit the issue tab for the list.
